Volumix resolves PipeWire playback nodes into stable logical applications and groups every session owned by an application behind one mixer target. Three browser streams should look like one **Brave** or **Firefox** control—not three nodes, renderer processes, or PIDs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Volumix is a source-only public alpha, not an end-user release. No supported binary package is published yet. Packaging, persistence, MIDI control, and the finished interface are not implemented. Initial Steam/Proton identification requires corroborating local process, compatibility-directory, and installed-manifest evidence.

## What works today

- Native PipeWire registry connection and playback-node events.
- Versioned C ABI with copied, serialized managed events.
- Linux `/proc` and cached XDG desktop-entry identity resolution.
- Deterministic multi-evidence scoring with safe conflict fallback.
- Stable fallback identities that never use PID.
- Multi-session application grouping and application-wide volume/mute commands.
- Managed reconnect supervision with generation isolation.
- Diagnostic CLI and minimal Avalonia shell.

The complete product contract is in [TECH_SPEC.md](TECH_SPEC.md). Start with the shorter [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) when contributing.

Planning is tracked in the canonical [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and mirrored to the [Volumix Roadmap GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/ATAC-Helicopter/projects/9). Alpha source snapshots and their checksums are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ATAC-Helicopter/Volumix/releases).

## Build

Install the dependencies in [the Linux setup guide](docs/development/setup-linux.md), then run:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

Inspect current logical applications:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Volumix.Cli -- apps --watch
```

Exercise the shared M0 command path:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Volumix.Cli -- set <canonical-id> 35
dotnet run --project src/Volumix.Cli -- mute <canonical-id>
dotnet run --project src/Volumix.Cli -- unmute <canonical-id>
```

These commands currently open a short-lived PipeWire client. A later milestone will route them through the single running instance over D-Bus.

## Scope

Volumix is not a PipeWire graph editor, DAW, DSP host, recorder, virtual-device manager, or network audio server. See [product scope](docs/product/scope.md).

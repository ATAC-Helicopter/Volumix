# Volumix roadmap

This is the canonical product and delivery roadmap for Volumix. GitHub issues, milestones, pull requests, project items, and changelog entries mirror this file; they do not define a competing scope.

## Work-item protocol

- Product and engineering work uses `VMX-xxxx`.
- Defects use `BUG-xxxxx`.
- Release and qualification gates use `REL-xxxxx`.
- IDs are allocated sequentially within their namespace, never reused, and never renumbered when plans move.
- Each execution item has exactly one owning ID.
- `P0` is release-blocking reliability, security, privacy, or accessibility work; `P1` is primary milestone value; `P2` is valuable deferrable work.
- Roadmap checkboxes are canonical delivery state. GitHub status, milestone, labels, and project fields must agree.
- A changelog entry representing user-visible or release-scope work includes its owning ID.
- Scope and acceptance text remain in this roadmap. GitHub issue bodies may add implementation notes without weakening this contract.

Canonical ticket format:

```text
- [ ] `VMX-0001` `P1` Clear one-line scope.
  - Scope: Exact implementation boundary.
  - Acceptance: Observable completion condition.
```

## M0 — PipeWire application identity spike

**Status:** Complete and published.  
**Tag:** `v0.1.0-m0`

- [x] `VMX-0001` `P0` Establish the repository, solution, architecture rules, and open-source governance.
  - Scope: .NET solution, project boundaries, build policy, documentation, GPL license, contribution rules, and CI.
  - Acceptance: repository builds with warnings as errors, documentation states current limitations, and governance files are present.
- [x] `VMX-0002` `P0` Define the application-centric core domain.
  - Scope: stable identifiers, identity evidence/confidence, audio sessions, runtime applications, mixer targets, and immutable snapshots.
  - Acceptance: Core has no platform dependencies and PID never participates in persistent application identity.
- [x] `VMX-0003` `P0` Implement the versioned native PipeWire C bridge.
  - Scope: context lifecycle, registry playback-node discovery, metadata, volume, mute, event callback, and explicit ownership.
  - Acceptance: the bridge compiles with strict warnings, connects to the user PipeWire instance, observes add/remove/change events, and passes lifecycle tests.
- [x] `VMX-0004` `P0` Implement managed native interop and serialized backend events.
  - Scope: ABI validation, P/Invoke lifecycle, immediate callback copying, normalized records, and channel delivery.
  - Acceptance: unmanaged pointers remain inside the boundary and fake native events are testable without PipeWire.
- [x] `VMX-0005` `P1` Implement Linux process metadata and cached XDG desktop identity.
  - Scope: race-safe `/proc` access, desktop parsing, `Exec` normalization, indexing, evidence, confidence, and stable fallbacks.
  - Acceptance: native, browser, missing process, disappearing process, ambiguous desktop, and executable fallback fixtures pass.
- [x] `VMX-0006` `P0` Aggregate sessions into logical applications through one state coordinator.
  - Scope: serialized add/change/remove handling, canonical grouping, generation isolation, immutable snapshots, and command fan-out.
  - Acceptance: multiple same-identity sessions form one application and application commands affect only its sessions.
- [x] `VMX-0007` `P1` Provide M0 application diagnostics and control through `volumixctl`.
  - Scope: list/watch applications and diagnostic volume/mute commands.
  - Acceptance: output shows canonical identity, confidence, sessions, runtime PIDs, volume, mute, and icon without persisting runtime data.
- [x] `VMX-0008` `P1` Establish the minimal Avalonia application shell.
  - Scope: narrow vertical empty state, view-model separation, and system/light/dark theme infrastructure.
  - Acceptance: compiled XAML builds without fake production data or business logic in code-behind.
- [x] `VMX-0009` `P0` Add repeatable managed/native build and test automation.
  - Scope: scripts, fixtures, GitHub Actions, central packages, formatting, and dependency direction checks.
  - Acceptance: all managed tests and native lifecycle tests pass in a prepared Linux environment.
- [x] `VMX-0010` `P0` Qualify multi-session control and managed reconnect generations.
  - Scope: two controlled silent playback streams, application-wide set/mute, unrelated-session isolation, and reconnect backoff.
  - Acceptance: both owned streams change together, unrelated audio remains untouched, and reconnect produces a new generation.
- [x] `REL-00001` `P0` Record the M0 evidence baseline.
  - Scope: build, unit-test, native lifecycle, live connection, grouping, volume, and mute results.
  - Acceptance: evidence is documented without claiming unperformed Firefox, Discord, Proton, or PipeWire-restart qualification.

## M0.2 — Real application and reconnect qualification

**Status:** Active.

- [x] `VMX-0011` `P0` Build an isolated PipeWire integration-test harness.
  - Scope: controlled daemon/socket, silent streams, deterministic teardown, and no mutation of unrelated user sessions.
  - Acceptance: CI-capable tests cover connect, add, change, remove, volume, mute, and reconnect without physical hardware.
- [ ] `VMX-0012` `P1` Qualify Firefox multi-stream identity.
  - Scope: multiple Firefox playback streams, `/proc`/desktop evidence, grouping, and stream recreation.
  - Acceptance: Firefox appears once with a stable canonical XDG identity and every owned session follows commands.
- [ ] `VMX-0013` `P1` Qualify Discord or equivalent Electron application identity.
  - Scope: renderer/process ambiguity, desktop corroboration, grouping, and diagnostics.
  - Acceptance: the user-facing identity is the installed application, not Electron or a renderer helper.
- [ ] `VMX-0014` `P0` Add the first Steam/Proton identity fixture and qualification path.
  - Scope: synthetic process/compat metadata, resolver seam implementation, stable Steam ID, and one real-game comparison when available.
  - Acceptance: a Proton audio stream resolves to `steam:<app-id>` without using Wine loader or PID as identity.
- [ ] `VMX-0015` `P0` Qualify PipeWire restart and reconnect end to end.
  - Scope: disconnect signal, unavailable snapshot, bounded backoff, registry rebuild, stale-event rejection, and command recovery.
  - Acceptance: an isolated PipeWire restart produces no duplicate applications and resumes correct control.
- [ ] `VMX-0016` `P1` Harden native ownership and sanitizer coverage.
  - Scope: ASAN/UBSAN test job, callback lifetime stress, rapid node churn, and shutdown races.
  - Acceptance: native tests are clean under sanitizers with deterministic lifecycle behavior.
- [ ] `VMX-0017` `P1` Enforce protected mainline collaboration on GitHub.
  - Scope: protect `main` from deletion and force-pushes, require pull requests and the strict `linux` status check, and preserve an auditable repository policy.
  - Acceptance: an active GitHub ruleset enforces the documented policy; any hosting-plan or visibility dependency remains explicitly tracked until resolved.
- [x] `BUG-00001` `P0` Keep roadmap synchronization working after a milestone closes.
  - Scope: update managed issues through the GitHub REST API using milestone numbers instead of CLI lookup by open-milestone title.
  - Acceptance: a full apply can update issues assigned to closed `M0` and synchronize every project item without error.
- [x] `VMX-0018` `P1` Establish the first public Volumix branding and project presence.
  - Scope: curate theme-aware repository wordmarks, preserve descriptive asset names, and publish an honest FG Labs project page linked to source and roadmap.
  - Acceptance: repository and website builds use the selected assets, describe the current early-development state accurately, and expose no generated filenames publicly.
- [ ] `REL-00002` `P0` Close the M0.2 qualification gate.
  - Scope: collect evidence for Firefox, Electron, Proton fixture, restart, sanitizers, and current limitations.
  - Acceptance: M0.2 evidence is reproducible and no unresolved P0 item remains.
